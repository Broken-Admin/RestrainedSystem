# RestrainedSystem
An abandoned HackNet extension with a slightly prepared story.
The first mission surrounding the idea of recruitment for a hacker group

## About this project
I started this project during a time of boredom and want to do something rather than study, it was done over a brief period of time and is currently abandoned.
The original trello can be found [here](https://trello.com/b/ssIPCwwo).

There are various docs online and an offical extension that is bundled with HackNet, which explains the development of extensions.

Have fun developing.
